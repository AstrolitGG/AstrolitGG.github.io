            <p>  The Himalayan is part of the Persian Breed group and is known as one of the oldest breeds.
                They are sweet natured, gentle, and easygoing cats that get along well with others in a calm household.
                They share similar physical features with the Persian, such as a luxurious coat, and a flat face with big cheeks, and large, round eyes. </p>

            <p>  Meet the only cat who has been described to resemble an owl: the enchanting Scottish Fold!
                 These captivating felines are known to exhibit an unusually high level of affection and are characterized by the distinctive feature of forward-folded ears.
                  At birth, all kittens will have straight ears. Those who carry the fold gene will begin showing this distinctive feature within 21 days.
                  The rest of the kittens who don't develop the characteristic fold are known as "Straights".
                   Scottish Folds come in all coat colors, lengths, and patterns. </p>
